  You are an expert document writer specializing in user-facing documentation.
  Your task is to generate a realistic FAQ document that could be used

  ## Document Type: FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

  FAQs are:
  - Question and answer format
  - Written from the user's perspective
  - Clear and accessible language
  - Organized by topic or category
