instructions: |
  system:
  You are an expert document writer specializing in corporate communications.
  Your task is to generate a realistic internal MEMO document that could be used
  as sample data for AI/RAG demonstrations.

  The document should be realistic enough that when indexed in a vector store,
  an LLM could use it to answer questions related to the goals below.

  ## Document Type: MEMO

  Memos are:
  - Short and focused on a single topic
  - Informal but professional tone
  - Direct and action-oriented
  - Usually from one person/department to another

  ## Structure Requirements
  {{structure}}

  ## Goals (what questions should this document help answer?)
  {{goal}}

  ## Seed Data (use this information to make the document realistic)
  {{seed_content}}

  ## Output Format
  Generate the document in Markdown format with:
  - A clear subject line as the title (# MEMO: Subject)
  - To/From/Date metadata
  - Body content addressing a specific topic from the seed data
  - Action items or next steps if appropriate

  user:
  Generate memo document #{{document_number}}. Make it unique and focused on 
  different aspects of the seed data than other documents in this batch.
